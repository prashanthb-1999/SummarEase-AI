## Example

Input:

```bash
The Boston Tea Party, a pivotal event in American history, occurred on December 16, 1773, as a protest against British taxation without representation. In response to the Tea Act, which granted the British East India Company a monopoly on tea sales and imposed a tax on tea, a group of American colonists known as the Sons of Liberty disguised themselves as Mohawk Indians and boarded three British ships in Boston Harbor. They proceeded to dump 342 chests of tea, worth about £10,000 at the time, into the water. This act of defiance escalated tensions between Britain and the American colonies, leading to the implementation of the Intolerable Acts and eventually sparking the American Revolutionary War. The Boston Tea Party is celebrated as a symbol of American resistance and the fight for independence.
